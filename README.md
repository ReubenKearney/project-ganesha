# Project Ganesha â€“ Value Driver Modelling POC

**Ganesha** is a scenario-driven tool that maps operational and financial drivers to free cash flow, 
helping identify which areas of the business constrain value the most.

Features:
- Interactive Streamlit app with scenario sliders
- Base vs Scenario comparison (monthly + yearly FCF)
- Elasticity analysis to rank drivers by cash flow impact
- CSV exports for deeper analysis

Run locally:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
